# FAQ — Welta

---

### What is Welta?  
Welta is an AI-native protocol that enables intelligent agents to directly interact with tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).  
It provides execution, orchestration, and automation infrastructure designed for the autonomous economy.

---

### Is Welta an RWA tokenization platform?  
No. Welta is not a tokenization platform — it’s the coordination layer.  
It connects tokenized assets, agents, and execution logic through composable infrastructure.

---

### How do agents interact with Welta?  
Agents gain native execution rights via Welta’s permission layer.  
They can read state, simulate flows, and trigger logic-based actions across vaults, assets, and compliance modules.

---

### Does Welta issue or custody RWAs?  
No. Welta is asset-agnostic and non-custodial.  
It interacts with RWAs via standardized interfaces — including registry adapters, oracle streams, and vault layers.

---

### Is Welta permissionless?  
The core protocol is permissionless and modular.  
Access controls, compliance rules, and agent scopes are customizable per deployment — from open experimentation to enterprise-grade enforcement.

---

### Does Welta have a native token?  
Not at this stage.  
Economic coordination mechanisms are under active design, with long-term governance and protocol utility in mind.

---

### Can Welta be used without AI?  
Yes — but it’s built for AI.  
Developers and protocols can use Welta manually or with rule-based logic, but the architecture is optimized for agent-native execution.

---

### How is Welta different from existing infrastructure?  
- AI is not an add-on — it’s the core assumption  
- Agents are first-class actors, not integrations  
- Execution is programmable, not reactive  
- RWA coordination is native, not externalized

### When is the launch?  
Welta is currently in active development.  
Agent sandbox environments and a testnet will launch in 2025.
