# Welta Architecture

---

## Overview  
Welta is a modular protocol designed for native interaction between AI agents and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).  
It operates as a programmable coordination layer — enabling autonomous execution, compliant asset orchestration, and intelligent strategy deployment.

The architecture is structured around composability, determinism, and native AI interfacing.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Interface Layer  
A standardized execution interface allowing AI agents to read, write, and trigger actions across Welta vaults and contracts.  
- Role-based agent permissions  
- Behavior modules (intent, prediction, simulation)  
- Stateless read access + controlled write execution  

### 2. Autonomous Vaults  
Smart contract containers for RWA portfolios — governed by logic, not users.  
- Configurable strategy execution logic  
- Multi-agent governance / arbitration  
- Native token support

### 3. Orchestration Engine  
Middleware for defining, simulating, and executing value flows.  
- Event-driven execution (data, agent signal, time)  
- Flow composition templates  
- Deterministic execution paths for predictability

### 4. Compliance Module  
Composable layer for legal, identity, and jurisdiction enforcement.  
- On-chain identity (DIDs, attestations, zk-proofs)  
- Rule-based access (jurisdiction, asset class, KYC tier)  
- Fully optional — builders can choose default or custom modules

### 5. Oracle & Data Streams  
Real-time integration of external data into execution logic.  
- Price feeds, asset metadata, legal state  
- AI-generated data pipelines (e.g. risk scores, news vectors)  
- Oracle-agnostic design (Chainlink, Pyth, custom providers)

## AI-Native Design Principles  
- Explicit Execution Rights  
  Agents aren’t observers — they’re actors. They can trigger vault logic directly, within permission boundaries.

- Deterministic by Default  
  Agents require predictable system behavior. Welta avoids hidden state or probabilistic flows.

- Simulation-Ready  
  Agents can test actions in pre-execution environments — with deterministic results.

- Composable Modularity  
  Builders choose what to enable: vault logic, compliance filters, data adapters — all as plug-ins.

## Interoperability  
Welta is chain-agnostic and built for connectivity.  
- Cross-chain messaging: LayerZero, CCIP, Wormhole  
- Asset bridge compatibility  
- Supports integration with legacy RWA protocols and future agent networks

---

## Security & Governance  
- Modular permissions  
- Configurable agent whitelists  
- Progressive decentralization model  
- Open audit & simulation framework (coming pre-mainnet)

## Summary  
Welta offers a clean, AI-native execution layer for interacting with tokenized real-world value.  
No UI assumptions, no reliance on human input — just logic, data, and machine-driven intent.

This is infrastructure for agents.  
This is Welta.
