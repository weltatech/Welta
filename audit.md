# Audit — Welta

---

## Overview  
Welta is building infrastructure for autonomous execution — which requires verifiability, predictability, and security by design.

Our audit strategy focuses on the most sensitive surfaces:  
- Agent execution interfaces  
- Vault logic and strategy orchestration  
- Cross-chain coordination and compliance modules

| Phase 2 | Orchestration engine, compliance filters, messaging layers | TBD | Scheduled — Post-testnet |

Internal simulations, red-teaming, and behavioral edge-case testing are currently in progress.
