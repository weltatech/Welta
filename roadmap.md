# Welta Roadmap

---

## Phase 0 — Genesis Layer  
- Ideation of AI-native financial primitives  
- Design of agent-executable RWA architecture  
- Simulations of autonomous value flows  
- Core protocol blueprint (no retrofits, no middleware)

---

## Phase 1 — Protocol Assembly  
- Agent-to-vault execution interface  
- Modular RWA token and metadata framework  
- Permissioned registry system with oracle hooks  
- Initial AI-agent sandbox (read/write capability on devnet)

---

## Phase 2 — Autonomous Liquidity  
- Launch of intelligent vaults (strategy containers with AI triggers)  
- Execution engine for agent-defined transaction logic  
- On-chain simulation environments for multi-agent coordination  
- Risk scoring, pricing, and rebalancing modules for tokenized assets

---

## Phase 3 — Network Awakening  
- Permissionless agent onboarding  
- Launch of public testnet with open SDK  
- Cross-chain messaging compatibility (LayerZero, CCIP)  
- Community-driven structured product templates  
- First composable agent-to-agent markets

---

## Phase 4 — Decentralized Intelligence  
- Mainnet launch  
- Progressive decentralization of governance  
- Ecosystem activation (agents, apps, validators)  
- Autonomous RWA clearing system  
- Integration with external AI systems and training data layers

---

## Phase ∞ — Continuous Evolution  
Welta is designed for agents that learn.  
We ship infrastructure that adapts — to new data, new assets, and new types of intelligence.  
This roadmap evolves as fast as the agents that build on it.
