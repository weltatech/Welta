# Team — Welta

---

## Who We Are  
Welta is built by a distributed team of protocol engineers, AI researchers, cryptography experts, and systems architects.

We operate at the intersection of intelligence, automation, and real-world capital — building infrastructure for a future that runs on logic, not legacy.

## Core Domains

### Autonomous Systems & AI  
Designing agent frameworks, execution logic, and simulation environments.  
- Backgrounds: autonomous agents, LLM-based orchestration, reinforcement systems  
- Focus: agent permissioning, behavior modeling, predictive architecture

### Protocol Engineering  
Architecting modular, AI-native infrastructure from scratch.  
- Backgrounds: smart contract engineering, distributed systems, protocol security  
- Focus: deterministic execution, vault design, on-chain coordination layers

### Real-World Asset Systems  
Standardizing interfaces between tokenized real-world assets and intelligent coordination.  
- Backgrounds: tokenization, asset registries, oracle infrastructure  
- Focus: RWA metadata, compliance modules, pricing feeds

### Ecosystem & Design  
Creating open tools, developer flows, and ecosystem incentives for autonomous coordination.  
- Backgrounds: infrastructure UX, technical writing, community activation  
- Focus: agent SDKs, plug-in modules, simulation playgrounds

## Operating Philosophy  
- Remote-native, globally distributed  
- Pseudonymous by design, verifiable by output  
- Focused on first principles, not narratives  
- Building for builders — and for agents
