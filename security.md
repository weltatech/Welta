# Security — Welta

---

## Philosophy  
In a system where agents can move capital autonomously, security is not optional — it’s foundational.

Welta is designed with a zero-assumption mindset:  
- Every actor may be adversarial  
- Every input may be manipulated  
- Every agent must be verifiable

Security is embedded at the architecture level — not retrofitted post-factum.

## Threat Model

### 1. Agent-Level Risks  
- Malicious agents triggering unauthorized flows  
- Rogue logic loops or unpredictable decision-making  
- Model poisoning or corrupted input streams

Mitigation:  
- Role-based agent permissioning  
- Simulation layer for pre-execution validation  
- Behavior boundaries and flow constraints

---

### 2. Vault & Asset Execution  
- Invalid or manipulated asset pricing  
- Cross-vault replay attacks  
- Misconfigured strategy execution

Mitigation:  
- Deterministic vault logic  
- Standardized asset interfaces and bounds  
- Oracle redundancy and verification

---

### 3. Cross-Chain Coordination  
- Message spoofing or relay interception  
- Out-of-order execution across networks  
- Bridge-layer vulnerabilities

Mitigation:  
- Secure messaging standards (LayerZero, CCIP)  
- Signed agent intents + execution proof layer  
- Event timestamping and idempotent logic

---

### 4. Compliance & Access  
- Circumvention of jurisdictional or identity rules  
- Unauthorized access to restricted assets  
- Faulty KYC/KYB integration

Mitigation:  
- Modular compliance plug-ins  
- On-chain identity primitives (DID, zk-credentials)  
- Policy-based execution filters per vault

---

## Engineering Practices  
- Modular codebase with risk isolation  
- Static analysis + fuzzing for vaults and execution logic  
- Test coverage across agent behavior surfaces  
- Internal red-teaming simulations

---

## Audit Status  
- Phase 1 audit scheduled for 2025 (vaults + agent interfaces)  
- Phase 2 audit to cover orchestration engine and compliance logic  
- Agent simulation testing ongoing in pre-testnet environments

## Responsible Disclosure  
To report a vulnerability, email: security@welta.tech
Bug bounty program to be announced closer to testnet release.

## Summary  
Welta is not secured by assumptions — it’s secured by architecture.  
Autonomous systems deserve trustless coordination, verifiable logic, and provable safety.  
That’s what we’re building.
