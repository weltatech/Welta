# Welta  
AI-native protocol powering next-gen RWA markets

---

## Overview  
Welta is an AI-native infrastructure protocol designed for the autonomous era of finance.  
It enables intelligent agents to interact with tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) natively — without intermediaries, silos, or legacy friction.

We’re building the foundation for a world where assets move across chains, borders, and systems — triggered not by humans, but by logic, algorithms, and intent.

Welta is not a bridge.  
It’s a control layer — for machines, capital, and trust.

## Core Principles  
- AI-first Design  
  A protocol built from the ground up for autonomous agents — not retrofitted for them.

- Composability Without Compromise  
  Open architecture that integrates with any RWA stack, oracle, or execution layer.

- Autonomous Coordination  
  Vaults, strategies, and asset flows governed by agents, not operators.

- Minimal Abstractions, Maximum Control  
  Transparent and deterministic — agents know exactly how the system will behave.

## What You Can Build with Welta  
- Intelligent vaults that manage RWA-backed portfolios autonomously  
- Cross-chain settlement engines with AI-defined execution logic  
- Protocols that price, verify, and tokenize assets without human input  
- Agent-based marketplaces where strategies compete without custody risk  
- Structured products that adapt to real-time data and predictive models

## Why Now  
AI is no longer a tool — it’s a participant.  
And RWAs are no longer optional — they’re inevitable.

But the rails don’t exist for agents and assets to meet — until now.

Welta gives AI the language, interface, and execution rights it needs to operate in the real economy.  
And it gives builders a platform to unlock a new class of applications.

## Built for Builders  
- Open SDK for agent-to-protocol interfaces  
- Modular architecture for custom flows  
- Plug-in system for risk models, oracle logic, and compliance modules  
- Testnets, documentation, and agent sandboxes coming soon

---

## Status  
Welta is in active development.  
Core components are being tested across agent simulation environments and AI-integrated devnets.  
Testnet scheduled for Q2 2025.
